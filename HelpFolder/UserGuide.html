            <p>
                PyTT code can be executed using Python. The file MAIN.py is the one in charge of starting the program execution.
                This method allows the user to execute the program in two ways: <br><br>

                If no input file is provided, the program will execute the user-friendly interface. <br><br>
                
                Example of execution with user-friendly interface: <br><br>
                <code> $ python3 MAIN.py</code> <br><br>

                If an imput file is provided the program will directly execute the simlation without loading
                Qt libraries. The program output will directly be stored in the Output folder files. <br><br>

                Example of execution without user-friendly interface:<br><br>

                <code> $ python3 MAIN.py Input.txt</code> <br><br>

            </p>

            <h2 id="Folder_Structure"> 2. Folder Structure</h2>

            <p>
                It is important for the folder structure to remain untouched as the program will look for certain files where 
                it believes they belong. The names of the folders and the files inside of them should also not be changed. <br><br>

                <input type="image" src="Pictures/FolderStructure.png" alt="Submit" width="600" height="300" class="center">
                
                <br><br>

                The main folder contains two very important files. MAIN.py that will execute the code and InputFile.txt
                which contains an example of <a href="#InputFile"> Input File</a> that might be used for the simulationsfor the simulations.

            <h2 id="InputFile"> 3. Input Parameters </h2>

            In the case the <a href="#QtInterface">User Interface</a> is being used, the necessary parameters can be provided by manually introducing 
            them in the respective cells. This process can be less time consuming if an input file is used. The input file must be a text but it's name
            can be changed. The structure of the file itself should be somewhat be conserved. 

            <br><br>

            This file is loaded into a python dictionary variable. This allows freedom in the order in which the different parameters 
            can appear, but limits the name this variables might take. All the variable names should remain as given in the example. They must finish 
            with ":" and there must be a space between the name of the variable and the value itself. Comments can be added next to each variable as 
            long as there is at least one space between the variable and the coment. The following image shows
            an example of input file. 
            <br><br>

            <br><br>

            All the paramenters required for the simulations should be given in the input file. Do not leave parameters empty. 
            The meaning of the different parameters will be covered in the different sections of this manual. We can clasify these 
            parameters in three groups: <a href="#BeamDescription"> Beam Parameters</a>, <a href="#DetectorDesc"> Detector 
            description parameters</a> and <a href="#Simulation" >Simulation Parameters</a>.

            <h2 id="BeamDescription">4. Particle Beam </h2>

            <h4 id="TypeEne">4.1 Particle Type and Beam Energy</h4>

            The beam of particles can be composed by any type of particle or ion, as long as the necessary information 
            for this incident particle is provided. The name of the incident particle/ion has to be provided to the "Particle:" variable, 
            and it will be interpreted as a String. If one is executing the program without user interface, the name of 
            the particle type to be used should be probided (e.g. Particle: ParticleInfo/Proton.txt ). If the user Friendly
            interface is used, the function UploadFile already takes care of writting the path for you, so only the name of 
            the particle is necessary (e.g. Particle: Proton ).
            
            <br><br> 

            Even if they are not available by default, other types of particles/ions can be used. For that it is only necessary
            to add another .txt file in this ParticleInformation folder following the same structure as the already present files. 
            Be aware that the <a href="#enedepdata"> energy deposition </a> in the detector is dependent on the material and the type 
            of particle. So in case of adding a new particle, a new file should be added as well in the folder EneDepData with the energy 
            deposition information. This will be further discussed later on. 

            <br><br>

            The variable "Energy:" allows the user to set the energy of the beam of particles. The program is not limited to 
            a range of energies as long as the necessary information is provided. That is, the correct energy <a href="#enedepdata"> energy deposition </a> 
            file is provided. 
            

            
            <h4 id="BeamSpace">4.2 Spatial Information</h4>

            The "BeamType" variable helps us set up the information about the spatial distribution of the particle beam. 
            It does not determine the total amount of particles at each point in space, but rather the proportion of 
            particles at each point. 

            If one set's this variable to "Gaussian", the program will interpret the beam shape as a 2D gaussian distribution:
            <br> <br> 

            <input type="image" src="Pictures/GaussianBeam.png" alt="Submit" width="450" height="150" class="center">

            <br> <br> 

            If this is the selected option, the parameters Posx ("x0"), Posy ("y0"), Sigx ("Sigma X") Sigy = ("Sigma Y") must
            be provided. 

            <br> <br> 

            A more general beam profile distribution can be probided by giving as an imput the name (and path) of a 
            file with the distribution of interest. (i.e. "BeamType: BeamDescription/GaussianProfile.txt").
            This file must include a two line header and then in this order, Horizontal position, Vertical Position 
            and the proportion of the particles at that point. For points laying in between the given space positions, 
            the particle proportion is calculated by means of a linear interpolations to the closest points. 
            When summing the particle proportions for all the space points, the result should be 1.

            <br> <br> 

            <h4 id="BeamTime">4.3 Temporal Information</h4>

            In all the cases the beam of particles is considered to be a rectangular time pulse. The variable 
            "Frequency" indicates how often we will have a particle beam. While the variable "PLength" indicates
            the temporal length of the particle bunch itself. 

            <br><br>

            <input type="image" src="Pictures/PulseStruct.png" alt="Submit" width="600" height="200" class="center">

            <br><br>

            <h4 id="BeamIntensity">4.4 Beam Intensity</h4>
            The variables "Intensity" and "Npart" are very closely related together by the following relation: 

            <br><br>
            <input type="image" src="Pictures/intensity.png" alt="Submit" width="250" height="150" class="center">

            Where Qe is the charge of the electron. Because they are directly interwined, it is only necessary
            to define one or the other. What is more, if both are defined an error will occur. Dor the case of 
            <a href="Wire2">Wire Scanner 2</a> this relationship is slightly more convoluted as the proportion of the 
            time the wire remains inside the particle beam is also conisidered (depens on velocity). 
            
            <br><br>

        
            <h2 id=MaterialInfo>5. Material Information</h2>

            <h4 id="MaterialSelection"> 5.1 Material Selection</h4>

            The variable "Material:" , as the name indicates, helps us select the material our detector will be made of.  
            Several materials are already provided in the MaterialInfo folder. If the <a href="#QtInterface"> User Interface</a>
            is being used, the relative path to the material file has to be provided. (i.e. "MaterialInfo/Tungsten.txt"). If the InputFile.txt 
            is being used, only the name of this file will be necessary. But be aware that the name needs to match one of the file names in This
            folder. This would be an example of the material information file that should be provided. 
            
            <br><br>

            <input type="image" src="Pictures/tungsteninfo.png" alt="Submit" width="450" height="300" class="center">

            <br><br> 

            The simulation program is not limited to the materials provided in the MaterialInfo folder. If another material is of interest
            a new text file can be added to this folder. The only limitation is that it must follow the structure of the already existing materials
            and it must contain all the necesary material information. Some of these paramenters might vary considerably 
            with temperature. In order to asses this variation the program accepts two types of inputs. If the value 
            given for a parameter is a float (i.e. WorkFunction: 4.5), this parameter will be considered constant for all 
            the temperatures reached during the simulations.
            
            <br><br>
            
            If instead of a float, a string is provided (i.e. SpecificHeat: Tungsten_Cp)
            , the program will go to the folder "ParametersWithTemperature" and will look for a text file with that name +".txt" (i.e. Tungsten_Cp.txt).
            All this files contain information about the parameters variation with temperature. These files always follow the same structure. 4lines of 
            header, and then two columns, temperature and value. If the value of the temperature is smaller than 300, the value of the parameter for 300 
            will be taken. If the temperature is higher than the maximum value probided, the parameter for the maximum temperature 
            provided will be considered. In the other cases a linear interpolation between the different temperature values will calculate
            the correct value of the parameter. 

            There is an option in the inputfile, "EnableParameterVariation:" which can be set to Yes or No. If No is provided, 
            even if a String has been given to some parameter values, the value of these parameter will be considered constant 
            and equal to the first value of the parameter in this tables. 

            <br><br>

            <h4 id="enedepdata"> 5.2 Energy Deposition</h4>
                The amount of energy depostied in the material is a parameter 
                that greatly affects the results of the simulations, as it is explained in the <a href="#PysicalModels">
                Physical Models</a> section. In order to allow the program to work in various ranges of energies 
                the parameter of the energy deposition has been left as an indirect input value. Several programs 
                can be used to calculate energy deposition (SRIM, ESTAR, PSTAR, Geant4, FLUKA, etc.) and it is left 
                to the user to select the method of their choice. 
                <br><br>
                This Parameter is basically dependent on the detector's material, the beam particle type and it's energy. 
                In the folder EneDepData one can find the files that the program uses to read the energy deposition. The File
                names follow the logic "Particle_Material.txt". Where "Particle" and "Material" are the particle name and 
                material name provided in input files. (i.e. "Particle: Proton", "Material: Carbon", the program will 
                load the file "Proton_Carbon.txt" that can be found in this folder). If we have a look at any of this files:

                We will see that they contain a header and two columns. The first column is the energy of the beam. 
                And the second one is the value of the energy deposition in the material (which must be previously calculated
                by other means.) As it is at the moment, the particle energy provided must match the beam energies on this 
                parameters. This files are uploaded as python dictionaries, the energy of the beam being the key. 
                <br><br> 
                If a the user is interested in an energy that is not provided by default, it can be easily added by adding 
                a new line in the corresponding document. If a new material or a particle type that is added to the program, 
                aside from the corresponding material and particle files an energy deposition file must be created following the 
                naming convention. 

            <h2 id="DetectorGeometry"> 6. Detector Type. </h2>

            Three different detector types are available. The variable "DetType:" determines the type of detector That
            will be used. Posible options are: SEM, FOIL, WIRESCAN. Even if in the input file variables for the other 
            types of detectors are defined, only the variables corresponding to the detector type chosen will be uploaded. 

                <h4 id="SEM">6.1 SEM Grid</h4>

                <input type="image" src="Pictures/SemGrid.png" alt="Submit" width="500" height="350" class="center">

                <br><br>

                The SEM grid detector is conformed of a certain number of wires that will be indicated with the 
                "NWires" variable. If the number of wires is even, the center of the beam will be in between the two 
                central wires. If the numbre of wires is odd, the center of the beam will lie at the center of the 
                central wire. The variables "Wwidth" and "Wlength" are self-explanatory and help the user to set the 
                Wire thickness and wire lenght. The variable "Wsep" determines the separation between the wires.
                Each one of these wires will be divided in smaller pieces. 
                
                <br><br>
                The size of 
                these pieces will be given by the variable "Wres" which stands for Wire Resolution. This wire resolution 
                determines how accurately we describe the space of our simulation. The smaller this value the more accurate we 
                will be. Nevertheless increasing the wire resolution increases considerably the computational power, 
                and it might induce inestabilities in the temperature simulation solvers. For more information about This
                check the <a href="#PhysicalModels">Physical Models</a> section, in particular, the <a href="ConductionSolvers">Solvers for 
                conduction cooling </a> section. Notice that the space coordinate in the direction of the beam will not be reduced to smaller
                pieces. This program is only valid for thin materials. Thin in the sense that the energy deposition in the material
                is considered constant along the width. 

                <br><br> 

                The horizontal and vertical selection boxes ("H","V") indicate if the simulation of interest should measure the horizontal or 
                vertical transverse profile of the beam. In practice what this changes is the orientation of the wires of the SEM grid. That is, 
                if the "H" cell is selected, the wires will lie on the Y direction, while if "V" is selected, they will lie on the Horizontal
                direction. Both boxes cannot be ticked at the same time. 

                <br><br>

                The variable "Nturns" indicates how many beam pulses are going to be simulated. The length of the simulation will be determined by 
                the total number of pulses and also parameters like the "dtpulse" and "dtcooling" that will be explained in the 
                <a href="#SimuPar">Simulation Parameters</a> section.            


                <h4 id="Foil">6.2 Foil</h4>

                <input type="image" src="Pictures/Foil.png" alt="Submit" width="500" height="350" class="center">
                <br><br>

                The dimensions of the foil perpendicular to the particle beam are determined by "Xwidth" and "Ywidth". 
                The variable "Zwidth" determine the thickness of the foil. Here again, it is required for the foil thickness to be 
                small. The foil will be divided in a certain number of cells. The number of horizontal divisions will be determined
                by the "Nx" variable, while the number of vertical divisions will be determined by the "Ny" variable. 
                As in the case of the SEM grid. The higher this number of divisions the more accurate the simulation will be spacially, 
                but also the more computationally demanding. 

                <br><br>

                Againg, as in the case of the SEM grid, the variable "Nturns" indicate how many beam pulses are going to be simulated. 

                <h4 id="Wire">6.3 Wire Scanner </h4>

                This detector consists
                in one single wire. With a wire lenght described by "wLength" and a wire thickness of "wWidth". The spatial resolution of the 
                wire will be described by the "wRes" variable. Same explanations as in the case of the SEM grid apply here, the smaller 
                this value the more precise but the more computationally demanding the simulations. As in the case of the SEM grids, one can 
                decide to go for a horizontal transversal profile measurement "H" or a vertical profile measurement "V". This determines 
                the direction of the movement of the wire. "H" means the wirre will be laying on the vertical direction and move horizontally. 
                The variables "Ini" and "End" determine the initial and ending position of the scan. The variables "H" and "V" will determine if 
                this initial and ending position are in the Y or the X axis. 

                <br><br>

                This program can simulate two types of wire scanners (W.SCAN 1 and W.SCAN 2). Both of them are the same type of detector but 
                the logic on the movement is slightly different. 

                <input type="image" src="Pictures/WireScan.png" alt="Submit" width="500" height="350" class="center">

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wire 1:</b>
                         The first type of wire scanners defines the fast wire scanners. It was very difficult to coordinate a temporal beam bunch 
                         structure and the wire movement, so in this case, instead of having a beam bunch, we have a continuous beam, with the 
                         same intensity at each instant of time. This might be an over estimation of the real exposure. In this case, the 
                         wire will move at a velocity that can be set by the "Wspeed" variable. This will determine for how long the wire is 
                        exposed to the beam. Variables such as "dtPulse" annd "dtCooling" do not play a role in this type of simulations, 
                        due to the nonexisting beam pulse structure. The simulation length will always be the same. By default the time in
                        this simulations will be divided in 100000 points. That is, from point Ini to point End, the wire will move 
                        100000 times, the position where this wire is at each one of these points will be determined by the speed of the wire. 
                        Also the time it will take the wire to do this 100000 points will be determined by the wire speed. 
                        <br><br> 
                        In this case the intensity of the beam will not be as easily related to the number of particles as in the other 
                        cases. For this particular simulations, the variable Nparticles is the one that should be used.  
                        <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Wire 2:</b>
                        The second type of wire scanner defines what could be called bunch per bunch wire scanner. The wire scanner will measure 
                        one point of the beam profile every beam pulse. That is, it will start at the Ini position and every time there is a 
                        beam pulse it will advance its position until it reaches the end. In this case the speed of the wire scanner is not really 
                        important as it will remain still every beam pulse. The variable N pulses determines, the lenght of the simulations
                        as in the SEM grid and FOIL cases, but in this case it also determines how accuratelly the beam profiled is measured as 
                        more pulses implie more points in the curve.

            <h2 id="SimuPar"> 7. Other Simulation Parameters</h2>

            This simulation program is able to perform two types of simulation. "TEMPERATURE SIMULATION" refer to the 
            simulation of the thermal evolution of the detector along time. "INTENSITY SIMULATION" refer to the simulation of 
            the current generated in the detector along time. In order to perform this simulations the corresponding boxes 
            have to be ticked or the variables "TempSIM:" and "IntSIM:" must be set to "Yes". If that is the case, the corresponding 
            parameters in have to be provided. <br><br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Temperature Simulation Parameters:</b>
                    First we should select the which cooling mechanisms wull be considered in the simulation. At least one of them must be active. 
                    In order to do that, we either check the box in the User interce or we set the variables "RadiativeCooling","ThermionicCooling",
                    "ConductionCooling" and "SublimationCooling" to Yes or No, depending on our interest. Note that the ConductiveCooling method 
                    might slow down the simulations considerably. The variable "T0" is used to set the initial temperature of the detector. 
                    <br> <br> 

                    Finally, the variables dtPulse and dtCooling are directly related to the time division of the simulation and will determine it's length
                    and accuracy. For the simulations, the time will ve divided in smaller pieces, and th etemperature calculation will be done in between 
                    this time steps. "dtPulse" is the lenght of the time steps when the beam is impinging the detector. Take into account that this 
                    variable must be smaller than the pulse lenght. It is recomended to have at least ten points in time during the beam pulse. 
                    The variable "dtCooling" is the same but it accounts for the division of the time when there is no beam of particles reaching the detectors
                    that is during the cooling fase. Again, this variable should be smaller than the time it takes the detector to cool down. Around 100 
                    points are recommended in this case so a smooth cooling is observed. Be aware that after a certain point reducing this values, 
                    or what is the same increasing the number of simulation steps will not impruve the simulation accuracy but it will make each simulation 
                    very time consuming. 

                    <br><br> 

                    For the specific case of the <a href="#Wire">Wire Scanner</a> 1, this values are not used, they can either be left blank or not 
                    but the program will not read them. In that case the simulatoin will always take 100000 time steps.

                </li>
                <li><b>Intensity Simulation Parameters:</b>
                    Even if they are clasified as Temperature simulations, the parameters "dtPulse" and "dtCooling" need to be set for the intensity 
                    simulations. It is actually recomended that whenever an intensity simulation is of interes, the thermal simulation is also performed
                    as things such as thermionic emission could affect the intensity result. As explained in the <a href="#PysicalModels">Physical Models</a>
                    section, the charge in the detector will be generated by mainly two means. Charge deposition and secondary emission. 
                    The secondary emission part is calculated internally and depends on the properties of the material and energy deposition. Whereas in
                    order to calculate the energy deposition we need a little more information. The parameter "mu" indicates the proportion of 
                    electrons that remain in the detector. That is, if the incident particle/ion has some electros, what proportion of them will remain 
                    in the detector. Similarly, "eta" indicates   the proportion of protons that remain in the material. 
                    "BS" indicates the proportion of backscatered electrons.

            <h2 id="Output">8. Output Files </h2>

            When executing the simulations with the userfriendly interface, an output window will open at the End
            of the simulations. This window will contain some very simple graphs with the most representative 
            results of the simulation. Independenly of the User interface being used or not, several files
            will be created in the OutputFiles folder at the end of the simulations. The file "InputFileUsedForSimulation.txt"
            contains the input values that were used for the simulation. 
            <br><br> 
              The file "MaxTempVSTime.txt" stores, as it's name indicates, the maximum temperature reached by the detector
              as a function of time. At each instant of time it also indicates the value of the emissivity at that point, and 
              in the case of wire scanner simulations, it indicates its position. 
              The file "IntensityVSTime" stores the information of the intensity generated in the detector as a function 
              of time. If it is a SEM grid this document will store the information of each one of the wires.
