PyTT release notes

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1.0 (2025-02-01) 

This version was focused on bringing back the correct simulation 
of SEM-grids (i.e. multiple, fixed wires) and on some code refactoring,
however there is still a lot to be done there.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0.1 (2024-06-01) 

Corrected bug on secondary electron current calculation.
Update manual.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0.0 (2024-05-24) 

This is an initial release of a frozen tested version of the PyTT. 
The code has been tuned to principally agree with the 2008 version
(see PyTT doc and manual). It focuses on wire scanner simulation 
(other cases were not tested). 

The numeration starts from version 3.0.0 because:
1. version 1 is considered to be the python 2.7 version from 2016
2. version 2 is the python 3 version from 2020, used in PhD thesis
    of Araceli Navarro

Version 3 is largely based on version 2, however in numerical terms 
comes back to some ideas of version 1 (eg. the numerical integration
of gaussian or the way the energy balance is computed).

Version 3.0.0 is not well debugged and polished, as resources are scarce,
but it is released anyway to be a reference while the code continues to
be developed.
