# This module contains functions to compute ther electric and magnetic field of particle bunch.
# A bunch electric field model must provide the electric field in the REST FRAME of the bunch!
#     .. note::
#       The bunch magnetic field is computed via Lorentz transformation from the bunch
#       electric field (still to be done).
# based on Virtual-IPM code
# (virtual_ipm/simulation/beams/bunches/electric_field_models.py)

    here we don't use tolerance
